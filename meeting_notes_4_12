Things to do:
- Check if Mark's standard- and interval-SVM implementations work correctly testing different lambda's. Recover losses, beta's, and beta0's and compare with Hastie implementation.
- Fix formatData functions. Keep star data format as is. For simulated data, use [Y X] (point data) and [Y X S] (interval data) formats
- Incorporate kernel functions.
